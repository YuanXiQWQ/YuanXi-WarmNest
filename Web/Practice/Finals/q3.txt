// Strengths:
// Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Handles multiple connections simultaneously, improving scalability for real-time apps.
// Single Programming Language: JavaScript for both client and server-side simplifies development.
// Large Ecosystem: Extensive npm registry provides a wealth of libraries and tools.
// Good for I/O Bound Applications: Efficiently handles data-intensive operations, such as streaming.

// Cons:
// Not Suitable for CPU-Intensive Tasks: Single-threaded nature can be a bottleneck for heavy computational tasks.
// Callback Hell: Complex nested callbacks can lead to harder code management, though Promises and async/await have mitigated this issue.
